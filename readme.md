# FAKE NEWS ANALYSIS ON TWITTER USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

Develop a system which will analyze fake news shared on Twitter using various machine learning techniques

## Getting Started

* To collect the data from twitter using twitter scrapper.
* To detect the news, which is a classic text classification problem with a straight forward     proposition. 
* To build a model that can differentiate between “Real” news and “Fake” news.


### INTRODUCTION

* Improvising Information Technology
* Increasing audience on social media 
* Uses of social media platforms
* Challenges on social media
* Problem arises with Rumors 
* Solution by Machine Learning techniques 


## Proposed Approach (Dataset & Algorithms)

###Collecting the data
    ->LIAR Dataset

###Classification the Data(Algorithms)
    -> Naïve Bayes
    -> Logistic Regression
    -> Support Vector Machine
    -> Stochastic Gradien Descent
    -> Random Forest Classifier
